            <h3>Life Journey</h3>
            
            <p>My background is in the Arts and I worked as an art director/designer in theatre, film and television before training as a therapist. I have worked in South Africa, Canada, USA, France and the UK, where I now reside. I set up FreshStart in 1999 with 3 other colleagues, as I could see that there was a need for affordable long-term therapy and the need for therapist to work with clients. As I supervise many of the trainee therapist,  I know just how dedicated they are to serve their clients to the best of their abilities.  I now practice as a <strong> UKCP accredited and registered</strong> Psychotherapist and supervisor. I adhere to the rules of professional conduct for UKCP.</p>
            
            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
            
            <p>As a therapist my aim is to assist clients on their journey to get to know themselves on a deeper level and therefore are enabled to make informed decisions about issues they face.  Clients often need to feel heard and seen and finding the right approach for them in different aspects of their lives is important.  I firmly believe that  awareness ,  is key to changing our lives in a way that is in our best interest.  Awareness is key to knowing yourself and key to becoming an emotionally healthier individual.  The world often is a good mirror to how our world is inside and taking responsibility for that is often difficult and painful, but I believe a worthwhile battle. We all have to find our very own meaning to our lives and it is always a privilege to accompany clients.</p>
            
            <h3>How I work</h3>
            
            <p>My task is always to find the language that best suits the client. My integrative approach allows me to use different approaches to ensure that a client is able to explore different challenges at different levels of consciousness. In my experience Clients need to feel  listened to in a strictly confidential, secure and safe setting. This allows issues to be understood and appropriate solutions identified as quickly and appropriately as possible. Creativity is about solving challenges and therefore I use that to support clients to find solutions to what is blocking them to a deeper understanding of themselves and then others. Because I practice as an integrative psychotherapist I am not bound to any one philosophy and so am able to choose and agree with each client which therapeutic approach (from cognitive (CBT) through humanist or psychodynamic to existential) is appropriate. At best this results in a unique language  created by the client.</p>
            
            <h3>My experience</h3>
            
            <p>In addition to my work as a therapist and supervisor I run many workshops on various subjects such as listening skills, PND, attachment theory and many other topics.  I also work with another Charity called <a href="https://www.homestartwestminster.org.uk/">Home-Start Westminster</a> where we support families with at least one child under the age of 5. I have set up various projects within this charity i.e. Bump-Start that supports pregnant women and their babies until the baby is 1 years old.</p>

I retired from the law in order to complete my studies in psychotherapy. Having worked in the City I have personal experience of working in high pressured professional environments and the stresses and strains that those working conditions can engender. Many of my private clients come from that work background. I have a particular interest in psychological issues that arise for individuals where there is a conflict between their work environments and their private lives.</p>
